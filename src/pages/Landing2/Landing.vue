          We believe in personalized clinical and behavioral interventions
          adapted to each individual over generalizable interventions. We build
          AI products to deliver interventions adapted to the individualâ€™s
          genes, environment, and habits to ensure each person lives their
          healthiest possible life. We are committed to making AI technologies
          available to everyone

          Human behavior constitutes the primary mode for activating health
          improvements, including decisions made by clinicians and their
          patients. We build software to provide medical care teams and patients
          with personalized AI support

        <div class="small-paragraph">
          Our machine learning platform and AI products support equitable access
          to healthcare by using mobile health-based adaptive interventions
          explicitly designed to support health workers and patients in
          resource-poor settings. Increase testing and surveillance, improve
          treatment adherence and chronic disease management, boost provider
          skills and quality of care, and prevent drug stockouts in pharmacies
          and clinics

          Our goal is to increase the participation of underrepresented
          populations in clinical trials with decentralized and adaptive
          designs. We build AI products that bring the studies closer to
          real-world situations, and make them safer and more robust. Recruit
          participants based on the likelihood of completing the study, increase
          their diversity, and keep them meaningfully engaged with personalized
          incentives and gamification elements

          statistical and machine learning. Promote an adequate level of
          engagement of healthcare professionals and their patients with
          tailored recommendations and incentives to support their

        <div class="paragraph">
          The ambition of personalized medicine is to design and optimize the
          pathway for diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by
          using large multidimensional biological datasets that capture
          individual variability in genes, function, and environment. We develop
          software that reconciles multiple different data sources to
          personalize diagnosis and treatment, improve prognosis, and open the
          door to a new era of evidence-based, individualized clinical practice

          Our products connect to medical equipment and patient management
          software to provide clinicians with decision architectures in which
          optimal clinical actions for each patient at each time are suggested.
          Recommendations are based on their history of clinical manifestations
          and treatment, genome, epigenome, microbiome, exposome, and other
          contextual and healthcare information. We use deep reinforcement
          learning to optimize sequential decision-making and dynamic treatment

          Our software uses AI to uncover previously undetected patterns in very
          large multidimensional datasets, making new biomarkers available for
          diagnosis, treatment personalization, and risk stratification. We
          develop AI products to provide each patient with the best existing
          therapeutical option for them and, beyond that, aspire to become the
