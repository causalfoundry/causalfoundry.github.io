export const MISSION = `
We believe in tailored solutions over one-size-fits-all approaches. 
Our AI products deliver personalized strategies adapted to individual
preferences, environments, and behaviors, empowering organizations
to achieve exceptional outcomes. Committed to democratizing AI and
reinforcement learning, we make transformative technology accessible
to everyone, driving innovation and delivering personalized success at scale`;

export const PRECISION_NUDGING = `
    Human behavior constitutes the primary mode for activating health
    improvements, including decisions made by clinicians and their
    patients. We build software to provide medical care teams and
    patients with personalized AI support
`;

export const GLOBAL_HEALTH = `
    Our machine learning platform and AI products support equitable
    access to healthcare by using mobile health-based adaptive
    interventions explicitly designed to support health workers and
    patients in resource-poor settings. \n\n
    Increase testing and surveillance, improve treatment adherence and chronic disease
    management, boost provider skills and quality of care, and prevent
    drug stockouts in pharmacies and clinics`;

export const CLINICAL_TRIALS = `
    Our goal is to increase the participation of underrepresented
    populations in clinical trials with decentralized and adaptive
    designs. We build AI products that bring the studies closer to
    real-world situations, and make them safer and more robust. Recruit
    participants based on the likelihood of completing the study,
    increase their diversity, and keep them meaningfully engaged with
    personalized incentives and gamification elements`;

export const MOBILE_HEALTH = `
    Our software organizes data from wearables, mobile applications, and
    other portable devices, turning it into actionable insights through
    statistical and machine learning. Promote an adequate level of
    engagement of healthcare professionals and their patients with
    tailored recommendations and incentives to support their
    decision-making, condition management, treatment adherence, and
    capacity building`;

export const PRECISION_MEDICINE = `
    The ambition of personalized medicine is to design and optimize the
    pathway for diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by
    using large multidimensional biological datasets that capture
    individual variability in genes, function, and environment. We
    develop software that reconciles multiple different data sources to
    personalize diagnosis and treatment, improve prognosis, and open the
    door to a new era of evidence-based, individualized clinical
    practice`;

export const CLINICAL_SOFTWARE = `
    Our products connect to medical equipment and patient management
    software to provide clinicians with decision architectures in which
    optimal clinical actions for each patient at each time are
    suggested. Recommendations are based on their history of clinical
    manifestations and treatment, genome, epigenome, microbiome,
    exposome, and other contextual and healthcare information. We use
    deep reinforcement learning to optimize sequential decision-making
    and dynamic treatment regimes`;
