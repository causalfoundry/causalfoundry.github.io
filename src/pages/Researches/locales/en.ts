    sectionDescription: `
Our research encompasses advanced AI algorithms, including reinforcement
learning, causal inference, and survival analysis.
\n
Robust data frameworks and the results of our research are the
foundation of all our work and drives the development of our products.`,

    rlTitle: "Reinforcement Learning",
    rlDescription: `Reinforcement learning is a computational approach to understanding and automating goal-directed learning and decision-making without requiring
exemplary supervision or complete models of an environment in order to
achieve long-term goals.
\n\n
The principal direction of our research focuses on designing methods and
mechanisms for optimizing digital products experience and user outcomes.
This includes approaches from reinforcement learning with emphasis on
sample efficiency, and explainable AI including causal inference.
Examples include feature space pruning for linear and deep contextual
bandits, and restless bandits for outcome optimization in applications
with strong budget constraints. This allows us to develop practical
solutions that make optimizing choices in dynamic complex scenarios,
based on feedback, select contextual data and forecasts of alternative
outcomes.`,

    behavioralTitle: "Behavioral and Clinical Embeddings",
    behavioralDescription: `
Embeddings are numerical representations of items, users, or behaviors
in a high-dimensional space. These representations capture the essential
characteristics and relationships of the data.
\n\n
Our second research direction aims at leveraging the data curated on our
platform to learn rich representations that encapsulate the key patterns
useful for profiling clinical and behavioral dimensions of users, and
personalized recommendations and predictions. Specifically, we use
semi-supervised methods to map entities such as products, clinical and
user's behavior into numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, that
retain semantic relations and bring utility to downstream tasks.

    llmTitle: "Large Language Models",
    llmDescription: `
This research direction examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
to streamline access to pertinent analytical information on our
platform. We experiment with the reasoning and tool use capabilities of
generalist LLMs endowed with curated data access in order to improve
experience for uses on both ends: better personalized recommendations
for the application user, and enhanced discovery of deeper insights into
the data for the analyst.

    survivalTitle: "Survival Analysis",
    survivalDescription: `
Survival analysis, often referred to as time-to-event analysis, is
dedicated to studying the time period leading up to the occurrence of
certain events and event-risk factor identification. Our research is
centered on merging individual-level survival analysis predictions with
reinforcement learning algorithms as contextual information, including
the uncertainty associated with these survival predictions.
\n\n
The findings are integrated into our platform in both behavioral and
clinical embedding training and design of timely and adaptive
decision-making system. Furthermore, risk-based early-warning signals
and continuous cross-validation enable efficient data collection,
increased responsiveness and richer feature representation.
