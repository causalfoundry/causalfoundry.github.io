            <h3>Types of cookies according to who uses them:</h3>
            <p>
              There are two types of cookies in terms of the entity that manages
              the terminal or domain from which they are sent and that processes
              the data collected:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First-party cookies: These are the cookies that are sent to your
                terminal from CausalFoundry.ai.
              </li>
              <li>
                Third-party cookies: These are the cookies that are sent to your
                terminal from a terminal or domain that is not managed by
                CausalFoundry.ai but by another entity, which processes the data
                collected through the cookies. Since these cookies are sent by a
                third party, it is their specific conditions and mechanisms that
                dictate how to block and delete them.
              </li>

                while you are visiting a website. They are deleted once you

              </li>
              <li>
                Persistent cookies: These are saved on your terminal and the
                data collected can be accessed and processed during a certain
                period of time (determined by the entity responsible for the
                cookies), which may range from a few minutes to several years.
